# GesturesAndControls

## The Unity project contains two main scenes


-  OnScreenControlsSample where we demonstrate how to use on-screen controls in Unity, and also show different ways to utilize the New Input System Architecture in Unity
-  GestureSample, where we have easy-to-understand, clean implementations based on the EnhancedTouch library of the gestures:
  - Pinch
  - Swipe
  - MultiTouch
  - Flick
  - Edge Swipe
  - Long Press
  - Double Tap
